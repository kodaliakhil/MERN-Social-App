# Behavioral Questions 

- Why is there a career gap after your BTech?

```I took a two-year break after my BTech to focus on upskilling myself in MERN Stack, which is a combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I was determined to enhance my skills in this area to broaden my career opportunities and stay updated with industry trends.```

- Why are you leaving your previous company?

``` "I am seeking new opportunities that align with my career growth and professional development. While I am proud of the successful completion of two projects during my time at my previous company, the organization experienced a shift in project availability, leading to a restructuring of resources. As a result, I was asked to resign. I am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a new role where I can continue to make meaningful contributions and grow professionally. ```
